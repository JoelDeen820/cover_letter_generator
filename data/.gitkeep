My name is Joel, and I am in my fourth year studying Engineering Systems and Computing atthe University of Guelph. I am interested in the Photonics Software Co-op that is available with Ciena. I have experience in developing REST structured APIs, and debugging in both high leveland low level programming languages. I believe the skills I possess could contribute to yourteam. My experience to date has confirmed my desire to pursue a career in developing theInternet of Things and so I am extremely excited about this opportunity with Ciena.
